            <p>Jordan Terrell Carter (born September 13, 1995), known professionally as Playboi Carti, is an American rapper from Atlanta, Georgia. An influential figure among his generation, he has contributed to the progression of trap music and its rage subgenre. He first signed with local underground record label Awful Records in 2014, and later signed with ASAP Mob's record label AWGE, in a joint venture with Interscope Records two years later. Carter gained mainstream attention following the release of his eponymous debut mixtape (2017), which peaked at number 12 on the US Billboard 200 and spawned the Billboard Hot 100-charting singles "Magnolia" and "Wokeuplikethis" (featuring Lil Uzi Vert).<br><br>
                Carter's debut studio album, Die Lit (2018) saw further critical and commercial success, peaking at number three on the Billboard 200. Following a two-year hiatus, his second studio album, Whole Lotta Red (2020) debuted atop the chart and was met with critical acclaim; it was listed as among the greatest albums of that year by Rolling Stone and The Washington Post. He guest performed alongside Rich the Kid on ¥$'s 2024 single, "Carnival", which became his first song to peak atop the Billboard Hot 100. Carter is scheduled to release his third studio album later in 2024.<br><br>
                Aside from his recording career, Carter founded the record label and creative agency Opium in 2019, through which he has signed aesthetically-similar fellow Atlanta-based rappers Ken Carson and Destroy Lonely, as well as the trap duo Homixide Gang.</p>
